## ðŸŒ· HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT?

_You can use any local server environment for running web applications on your computer. In this situation, I clone a PHP project from GitHub and run it with XAMPP, you can follow these steps:_

1. **Install XAMPP**: Download and install XAMPP from the [Apache Friends website](https://www.apachefriends.org/) based on your operating system.

2. **Start XAMPP**: Once installed, open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking on the "Start" button next to them.

3. **Clone the GitHub project**: Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Use the following command to clone the project repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

4. **Move the project to XAMPP's htdocs folder**: Once the cloning is complete, move the cloned project folder into the "htdocs" directory of your XAMPP installation. By default, the "htdocs" folder is located at:

```
Windows: C:\xampp\htdocs\
```

```
macOS: /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/
```

```
Linux: /opt/lampp/htdocs/
```

5. **Access the project: Open a web browser and enter the following URL:**

```
http://localhost/project-folder
```

Replace project-folder with the name of the folder you moved into the XAMPP htdocs directory. For example, if the project folder is named "myproject," the URL would be:

```
http://localhost/myproject
```

6. **Test the project**: The PHP project should now be running through XAMPP. You can navigate through the project pages and interact with its functionality.

Make sure that your XAMPP Apache is running while accessing the project. You can stop the services once you are done with the project by clicking the "Stop" button in the XAMPP control panel.
